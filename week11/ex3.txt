On my system, stdout is line buffered
On fork the buffer is copied.

In the first program Hello is putted to the buffer without new line character.
Therefore, after the work when parent and child process put new line char,
then both processes flush their buffers to stdout and we see line Hello twice.

In the second program we put new line character immediately, therefore after fork 
both processes have empty buffers.
