In top we can see the following:
1. Initially, physicall memory consumption grows rapidly, but then it stops at some boundary
(on my system it happens the approx 7.5Gb of physical memory out of 8Gb are used). At this
moment sytems starts to use swap partition. The physical memory is still about 7.5Gb, but
used swap memory grows rapidly. Then the process goes to terminate, the swap usage starts decreasing.
When the swap is empty, physical memory consumption starts to decrease. Furthemore, here we can see
that out benchmarking process consumes quite a lot of CPU resources. At some moments it even dominates
all other processes in the system in terms of CPU usage.
