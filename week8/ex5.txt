The physicall address is the exact address of the byte in the main memory.
Virtual address is the address of the byte in virtual memory of the process.
Virtual address must be mapped to physical address before it can be used.
If two processes use the same physical address simultaneously, it usually leads
to failures or race conditions(if such "sharing" wasn't a goal). However, such
sutuation is impossible with virtual addresses until we share the byte explicitly.
Using physical address we can occasionaly access the memory used by OS. If it's
read-only, then our process will crash. Otherwise, if we change this byte it can
lead to unpredictable behavior of the system. Again, using VA it is not possible.
